Webmail client (Sending only)

This is the only exercise I've had to use an IDE for,
because I couldn't figure out for the life of me how to compile
in Java with all the needed libraries and then package it up for
Tomcat.

It uses Semantic-UI and Angular.js on the client side, with a
server side JSON API (Using GSON JSON library) for sending
messages.
